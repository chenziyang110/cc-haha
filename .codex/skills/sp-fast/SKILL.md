## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: The work is genuinely local and low-risk enough to stay on the fast path.
- **Primary objective**: Complete the smallest safe low-risk change directly and run the smallest meaningful verification without opening the full planning workflow.
- **Primary outputs**: A tightly scoped direct change plus a concise report of what changed, what was verified, and any remaining risk.
- **Default handoff**: Upgrade immediately to /sp-quick if scope, coupling, or uncertainty expands.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Objective

Execute a trivial, low-risk task directly in the current context without entering the full `specify -> plan -> tasks` workflow.

Use this for small fixes that are faster to execute than to plan: typo fixes, tiny config changes, missing imports, narrow doc edits, small bug fixes, and similarly bounded adjustments.

## Context

- Primary inputs: the user's request, the smallest relevant local files, passive learning files, and the project cognition safety gate.
- This path exists only for truly local work; the moment that assumption breaks, the task must leave the fast lane.
- Fast-path output is intentionally small and should not spawn planning artifacts.
- Upgrade out of fast immediately when senior consequence analysis triggers for lifecycle, running-state, destructive-operation, shared-state, downstream consumer, compatibility, security, or multiple-behavior impact; record only the stand-down reason if it does not trigger.

## Senior Consequence Analysis Gate

Run this gate whenever the request, artifact set, defect, or planned change can affect lifecycle operations, running objects, concurrent work, destructive behavior, shared state, downstream consumers, compatibility, security-sensitive behavior, or multiple plausible product behaviors.

Project cognition first. Use the project cognition runtime to identify ownership, consumers, state surfaces, change-propagation facts, verification routes, conflicts, known unknowns, and coverage gaps. Senior consequence analysis second. Turn those facts into explicit product and implementation obligations instead of treating the graph as the decision-maker.

Project cognition readiness drives routing. If readiness is `ready`, continue with the returned task-local bundle. If readiness is `review`, inspect only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing. If readiness is `ambiguous`, `needs_update`, `needs_rebuild`, or `blocked`, follow the workflow's routing rules before asserting consequence behavior. Carry relevant project cognition facts, returned `minimal_live_reads`, inference notes, and coverage gaps into the workflow's artifacts or durable state.

Required output when the gate triggers:

- **Affected Object Map**: name each object, record, worker, queue, artifact, command, API, file surface, user-visible state, or downstream consumer that can be affected.
- **State-Behavior Matrix**: describe behavior for each important lifecycle state, including created, queued, running, paused, failed, cancelled, completed, resumed, archived, missing, stale, or partially refreshed states when relevant.
- **Dependency Impact Table**: map direct dependencies, indirect consumers, shared state, compatibility surfaces, validation routes, and adjacent workflows that can break if semantics change.
- **Recovery And Validation Contract**: state rollback, retry, idempotency, cleanup, migration, observability, and validation evidence required before handoff or completion.
- **Coverage Gaps**: list what project cognition or live evidence cannot prove, who must resolve each gap, the latest safe resolve phase, the stop-and-reopen condition, and the routing decision: current workflow may continue with an assumption, must ask the user, must route to clarification or deep research, or must request map maintenance.
- **Consequence Obligations**: assign stable `CA-###` IDs to every obligation that must survive downstream handoff, task generation, worker packets, verification, or debug closeout. Each `CA-###` must include claim, affected objects, owner workflow, latest resolve phase, status, and stop-and-reopen condition.

Stand down only for docs-only wording changes, trivial isolated fixes, or local refactors that cannot affect lifecycle operations, running state, destructive operations, shared state, downstream consumers, compatibility, security, or multiple behavior choices. Record the no-trigger reason or stand-down reason in the workflow's durable artifact or closeout before skipping the required outputs.

If the gate triggers and the current workflow cannot preserve the required outputs, stop and route to the workflow that can. Do not mark ready, resolved, handoff-ready, planning-ready, or complete while triggered consequence obligations remain unresolved, unmapped, or unsupported by validation evidence.

## Execution Mode

## Dispatch Mode

Dispatch mode follows command tier, not a uniform rule.

| Tier | Dispatch Mode | Rule |
|------|---------------|------|
| trivial | leader-direct | No subagent dispatch. Leader performs and verifies the change directly. |
| light | subagent-preferred | Dispatch to one subagent; leader-inline fallback allowed if dispatch unavailable. |
| heavy | subagent-mandatory | Must dispatch. If dispatch unavailable, record reason and escalate. |

### Fallback (light tier only)

When subagent dispatch is unavailable for a light-tier command:
1. Record the reason in workflow state
2. Switch to `execution_surface: leader-inline`
3. Proceed with the same scope and verification gates

This is a designed fallback path, not an exception.

**This command tier: trivial. Dispatch mode: leader-direct.**

The leader performs the change directly. No subagent dispatch. No task contract needed.


## Scope Gate

Use `sp-fast` only when ALL of:
- ≤3 files touched
- No shared registration surface (router table, export barrel, template registry)
- No protocol/contract boundary crossed
- No dependency changes
- Task is clear in one sentence
- Root cause known (if bug fix)

If any check fails → upgrade to `/sp-quick`.
If scope >10 files or crosses module boundary → upgrade to `/sp-specify`.

## Fast Path Consequence Routing

The fast path may continue only when the Senior Consequence Analysis Gate does not trigger, or when it stands down with a recorded stand-down reason. If the gate triggers, upgrade out of `sp-fast` instead of adding planning artifacts to satisfy this gate on the fast path.

- Upgrade to `/sp-quick` immediately if the gate triggers with a bounded consequence model.
- Triggered gate with product, lifecycle, running-state, destructive-operation, shared-state, downstream-consumer, compatibility, security, or multiple-behavior semantics → route to `$sp-specify`.
- Stood-down or non-triggered gate → continue in `sp-fast` only after recording the stand-down reason in the fast-path closeout.

## Upgrade Triggers

Upgrade to `/sp-quick` immediately if:
- The Senior Consequence Analysis Gate triggers and the consequence model is bounded enough for lightweight tracking.
- The work expands to more than 3 files.
- The change touches a shared surface such as a router table, registration file, export barrel, template registry, or other coordination point.
- The project cognition runtime or change slice shows the touched area is a change-propagation hotspot, has explicit verification entry points beyond a trivial local check, or carries known unknowns that make safe direct execution unavailable.
- The requested work comes from `.specify/testing/UNIT_TEST_SYSTEM_REQUEST.md` and is larger than one tiny harness, command, fixture, or helper repair.
- The task stops being obvious and needs research or clarification to proceed safely.
- The task needs multiple subagent lanes, resumable tracking, or a written quick-task summary artifact.
- The work started as a bug fix, but root-cause analysis is still unresolved, competing causes are still plausible, or the next safe step is diagnostic investigation rather than a truly local repair. In that case, route to `$sp-debug`.

Upgrade to `/sp-specify` immediately if:
- The Senior Consequence Analysis Gate triggers for lifecycle, running-state, shared-state, destructive-operation, downstream consumer impact, broad compatibility handling, security, or multiple plausible behavior choices that need product semantics.
- The request introduces a new workflow, role boundary, or user-visible behavior that needs explicit acceptance criteria.
- The change carries compatibility, migration, rollout, or neighboring-workflow risk.
- The request is still a testing-system program from `.specify/testing/UNIT_TEST_SYSTEM_REQUEST.md` instead of a tiny local repair.
- The task is no longer a bounded local fix and now changes architecture, APIs, long-lived templates, or planning assumptions.

## Passive Project Learning Layer

Fast path does not load the full passive learning layer.

**This command tier: trivial.** Skip all learning hooks. Do not read constitution, project-rules, or project-learnings. Do not run learning start, signal, review, or capture. Learning Reflex is acknowledged but not executed on the fast path; leave `.specify/memory/learnings/INDEX.md` and any linked detail document untouched unless the task is upgraded out of the fast path.

## Process

1. **Scope gate**
   - Confirm the task fits the fast-path constraints above.
   - If not, stop and redirect to the right workflow instead of forcing the task through `sp-fast`.

2. **Pass the project cognition gate**
   - {{spec-kit-include: ../command-partials/common/context-loading-gradient.md}}
   - **Project cognition gate:** query the active project's runtime before broad
     repository reads.

     Run or emulate:

     ```text
     uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition lexicon --intent implement --query=\"$ARGUMENTS\" --format json
     # Agent: generate <query_plan_json> from raw user intent plus returned map terms.
     uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition query --intent implement --query-plan \"<query_plan_json>\" --format json
     ```

     Use the returned readiness:

     - `ready`: continue with the returned task-local bundle.
     - `review`: perform only the returned `minimal_live_reads` before continuing.
     - `ambiguous`: ask the user to select the intended candidate.
     - `needs_update`: route through `$sp-map-update`.
     - `needs_rebuild`: route through `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build`.
     - `blocked`: stop and report the blocking runtime issue.
     - **CARRY FORWARD**: Use project-cognition signals to decide whether
       fast-path execution is still safe. Carry the selected capability, minimal reads,
       and verification route into the fast-task state or report.
   - Only after the cognition gate passes may you read the source files to change.

3. **Execute the fast lane**
   - Perform the fast-path change directly.
   - Keep the allowed write scope local and explicit.
   - Before reading any non-obvious path, confirm the resolved path stays inside the repository and is not a credential, secret, private key, or other sensitive file. If path safety is uncertain, stop and ask for a safer explicit path instead of probing broadly.
   - If the task is behavior-changing rather than docs-only, write a failing targeted test or failing repro check before editing production code.
   - The direct execution notes must include that RED gate before production edits.
   - Do not use manual sanity checks as a substitute for red when behavior changes.
   - If no reliable automated test surface exists for the affected behavior, stop and redirect to `/sp-test-scan` or `/sp-quick` instead of hand-waving the verification gap.
   - If `.specify/testing/TESTING_PLAYBOOK.md` defines command-tier expectations for `fast smoke`, `focused`, and `full`, use fast smoke only as the cheapest early signal, run the focused tier as the fast-lane acceptance check, and reserve full for broader regression or final verification.
   - For bug fixes and regressions, record the current root-cause explanation before implementation starts. If the root cause is not yet known, or if multiple plausible causes are still in play, stop and route to `$sp-debug` instead of applying a quick symptom patch.
   - Keep the change as small and local as possible.
   - If the Senior Consequence Analysis Gate stands down, record the stand-down reason before continuing in `sp-fast`.
   - Do not add planning artifacts to satisfy this gate on the fast path. If required consequence outputs are needed, upgrade instead of manufacturing durable artifacts in `sp-fast`.

4. **Verify**
   - If playbook command tiers exist, focused is the fast-lane acceptance check.
   - Otherwise run the smallest meaningful local verification for the change.
   - Prefer targeted existing tests or a direct sanity check over broad workflows.

5. **Report**
   - Summarize what changed, what was verified, and any remaining risk.
   - [AGENT] Keep the fast-path closeout truthful: report the exact verification you ran and any residual risk instead of implying broader validation.
   - Include `changed_code_paths` with modified, added, deleted, and renamed paths.
   - Include `changed_behavior_surfaces` for commands, APIs, templates, generated assets, state files, tests, docs, validators, packets, or runtime assumptions affected by the change.
   - Include `verification_evidence` with the exact checks run and the result.
   - Include `project_cognition_refresh` recommending `$sp-map-update` with the changed paths whenever project cognition might be affected.
   - If the fast-path change unexpectedly touched truth-owning surfaces, shared surfaces, command/route/contract boundaries, verification entry points, runtime assumptions, or other map-level coverage facts, and verification is truthfully green and no explicit blocker prevents completion, refresh the project cognition runtime through `$sp-map-update` using the changed paths. Do not route to `$sp-map-scan` or `$sp-map-build` for ordinary uncertain closure; `sp-map-update` records partial/low-confidence facts, known unknowns, and `minimal_live_reads`. Rebuild through `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build` only when the baseline is missing, unusable, schema-incompatible, explicitly requested for rebuild, or invalidated by broad architecture replacement; then run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition validate-build --format json` and `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition complete-refresh --format json` only when build acceptance passes.
   - If a refresh cannot be completed now, use `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition mark-dirty --reason \"<reason>\" --format json` as the manual override/fallback and recommend `$sp-map-update` with the changed paths; escalate to `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build` only for the explicit rebuild conditions above.

## Output Contract

- Keep the outcome to one tightly scoped change set plus the minimum truthful verification evidence.
- Report what changed, which code paths were modified/added/deleted/renamed, which behavior surfaces moved, how it was verified, what residual risk remains, and whether `$sp-map-update` should refresh the cognition runtime from those changed paths.

## Guardrails

- No spec.md creation.
- No plan.md creation.
- No tasks.md creation.
- Use leader-direct execution only; if subagent lanes are needed, route to `$sp-quick`.
- Do not add planning artifacts just to satisfy process formality.
- If the task grows while working, stop and redirect to `/sp-quick`.
