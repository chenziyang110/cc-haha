## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: A project cognition baseline exists and repository changes or user supplements must update the runtime without a full rebuild.
- **Primary objective**: Compute impact closure, refresh affected evidence, update claims and conflicts, and update only the affected SQLite runtime records.
- **Primary outputs**: `.specify/project-cognition/status.json`, `.specify/project-cognition/project-cognition.db`, and query/update helper readiness metadata.
- **Default handoff**: Return to the blocked workflow once the affected query scope is green or yellow.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## Objective

Refresh the existing query-backed project cognition baseline incrementally from diff-driven evidence or explicit user corrections.

## Mandatory Subagent Execution

All substantive tasks in ordinary `sp-*` workflows default to and must use subagents.

The leader orchestrates: route, split tasks, prepare task contracts, dispatch subagents, wait for structured handoffs, integrate results, verify, and update state.

Before dispatch, every subagent lane needs a task contract with objective, authoritative inputs, allowed read/write scope, forbidden paths, acceptance checks, verification evidence, and structured handoff format.

Use `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`.
Use `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`.
Use `execution_surface: native-subagents`.

## Process

- Query the current project cognition baseline and determine the affected closure before editing runtime outputs.
- Prefer the smallest update that can truthfully restore readiness.
- Treat explicit user corrections and user-supplied scope as first-class routing input; user-supplied scope is authoritative for the touched area unless repository evidence disproves it.
- Dispatch only validated incremental update lanes with bounded affected scope.
- A tiny localized refresh may stay as one bounded lane even when native subagents are available.
- If a safe update lane cannot be packetized or delegated, record `subagent-blocked` with the affected paths and the smallest live-read recovery path; this is a dispatch/runtime blocker, not an excuse to skip the map-update duty.
- Update the affected runtime records that can be proven, and explicitly mark uncertain edges as partial, low-confidence, stale, or known-unknown instead of claiming the update cannot be performed.

## Git Delta Intake

- Start from Git, not memory: collect modified, added, deleted, and renamed paths from the current diff, supplied commit range, or explicit changed-path list.
- Filter changed paths through `.cognitionignore` before querying or patching the runtime. Read root `.cognitionignore` and `.specify/project-cognition/.cognitionignore`; both use gitignore-compatible syntax.
- User-supplied changed paths that match `.cognitionignore` are scope notes, not update targets. Report them as ignored unless a later `!` rule re-includes the path or the user explicitly changes the ignore rule.
- Treat user-supplied changed paths, behavior surfaces, and corrections as authoritative scope hints unless repository evidence contradicts them.
- Query `project-cognition.db` for each changed path before deciding update scope.
- For every changed path, look up current owner, consumers, lifecycle/state surfaces, shared mutable state, destructive-operation edges, generated-surface propagation, verification routes, conflicts, stale claims, and known unknowns.
- Expand the update closure through owners, downstream consumers, state surfaces, workflow artifacts, generated surfaces, and verification routes that project cognition already knows.

## Update-By-Default Rule

- Ordinary uncertainty is not an update failure.
- If the affected closure cannot be fully proven, still update the records that can be proven and record the rest as `partial_refresh`, low-confidence claims, conflicts, stale claims, `known_unknowns`, and `minimal_live_reads`.
- `sp-map-update` must not route to `sp-map-scan -> sp-map-build` merely because the closure is wider than expected, some consumers are ambiguous, or extra live reads are needed.
- Rebuild is reserved for missing baseline, unusable DB/status/schema, explicit rebuild request, or repository architecture replacement so broad that the baseline identity is invalid.

## Incremental Rule

- `sp-map-update` is the normal maintenance entrypoint after baseline build.
- It must accept both diff-driven and user-supplement-driven updates.
- It must update the query-backed cognition runtime incrementally.
- It must treat `.specify/project-cognition/status.json` plus `.specify/project-cognition/project-cognition.db` as the runtime truth source for post-update readiness.
- It must not silently escalate to a full rebuild without recording why.
- It must prefer metadata-only or single-slice updates when those are sufficient.
- After recording updates, re-evaluate runtime readiness through the shared freshness contract.
- After applying update records, run `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition validate-build --format json`.
- If the update helper returns `needs_rebuild`, `sp-map-update` must not call `complete-refresh`; report the concrete missing, unusable, schema-incompatible, explicitly-rebuild-required, or baseline-identity-invalid condition and route to `$sp-map-scan`, then `$sp-map-build`.
- If `validate-build` is blocked after update recording, report `partial_refresh` and preserve the validation errors instead of claiming the runtime is fresh.
- If the re-evaluated runtime is `fresh` with `readiness=ready`, finalize the successful refresh through `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition complete-refresh --format json` so cognition freshness metadata cannot remain stale.
- If the update helper returns `ready` and `validate-build` passes, but the shared freshness check still sees the same refreshed source paths only because those source changes are not committed yet, report the incremental update as recorded and baseline-finalization pending. Do not tell the user to run `$sp-map-scan` or `$sp-map-build` merely because refreshed source changes are not committed yet.
- After those source changes are committed, update the git-baseline freshness metadata with `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition record-refresh --reason \"map-update\" --format json` or `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition complete-refresh --format json` without rerunning `$sp-map-scan` or `$sp-map-build`, unless validation reports `needs_rebuild`, the baseline is unusable, or the affected closure cannot be bounded safely.
- Do not report refresh completion when the runtime remains blocked.
- A recorded refresh is not automatically a ready refresh: `partial_refresh` means update metadata was written but readiness still failed.

## Required Inputs

At minimum, read:

- `.specify/project-cognition/status.json`
- `.specify/project-cognition/project-cognition.db` through the
  `project-cognition` query/update helpers
- changed paths or changed commit range
- user supplement input if provided

Do not read or rewrite raw graph JSON artifacts; they are not runtime truth.

## Output Contract

The canonical outputs for this command are:

- updated `.specify/project-cognition/status.json`
- updated `.specify/project-cognition/project-cognition.db`
- query/update helper readiness metadata
- the post-recording freshness result, including `freshness`, `readiness`, and `recommended_next_action`
- when the post-recording freshness result is ready, a completed cognition refresh finalizer via `uvx --from git+https://github.com/chenziyang110/spec-kit-plus.git@a2f1f2ba1cdaf4f7a1c85870121c2ec3eb60f3f6 specify project-cognition complete-refresh --format json`

## Guardrails

- Do not silently escalate to a full rebuild without recording why.
- Do not refresh unaffected runtime records just because the touched area is ambiguous; record partial or low-confidence closure for the affected records instead.
- Do not invent closure when changed paths or user supplements do not support the update.
- Do not re-read or rewrite raw graph JSON artifacts; use the query/update helpers and the smallest affected runtime records that can truthfully restore readiness.
- Do not split small localized updates into parallel scan-style lanes just because subagents are available.
- If the affected update lane cannot be safely packetized or delegated, record `subagent-blocked` with affected paths and recovery evidence; do not describe ordinary ambiguous closure as impossible to update.
- Do not write `.cognitionignore`-excluded paths into update records, `known_unknowns`, or `minimal_live_reads`; report ignored paths separately so the operator can revise `.cognitionignore` when the exclusion is wrong.

## Escalation Boundary

- Escalate to `sp-map-scan`, then `sp-map-build` only when no query-backed baseline exists, the current baseline is unusable, DB/status/schema validation fails, the user explicitly requested a rebuild, or the repository architecture changed so broadly that the baseline identity is invalid.
- Do not escalate merely because the affected closure is uncertain; record the uncertainty as partial/low-confidence update data with `known_unknowns` and `minimal_live_reads`.
- Record the exact reason for escalation, including the failed baseline, DB, schema, explicit-request, or architecture-replacement fact.

## Update Duties

`sp-map-update` must:

- compute diff impact closure
- refresh affected evidence
- apply updates as a `patch-in-active-generation` operation against the current
  query-backed baseline unless validation proves a rebuild is required
- invalidate stale claims
- detect and repair stale retrieval signals, including obsolete aliases,
  colloquial user phrases, concept routes, and ownership hints
- update or create conflicts
- preserve or revise `selected_concepts` routing evidence when changed paths,
  user supplements, or runtime validation show that prior concept selection
  would now misroute a query
- preserve or revise `rejected_concepts` routing evidence when user corrections
  or repository evidence show that a plausible alias belongs to the wrong
  domain
- update affected runtime records with proven facts, low-confidence claims, conflicts, stale markers, known unknowns, and minimal live reads
- produce an incremental update record
- verify the shared freshness contract after the update record is written
- run the successful-refresh finalizer when that verification proves the runtime ready

## Codex Subagents-First Dispatch

When running `sp-map-update` in Codex, use the subagents-first dispatch model.
- Prefer the smallest executable update lane set.
- User-supplied scope remains authoritative unless repository evidence disproves it.
- Use `spawn_agent` for bounded lanes when `dispatch_shape` is `one-subagent` or `parallel-subagents`.
- Launch all independent lanes in the current `parallel-subagents` wave before waiting, but only after confirming the refresh is not metadata-only or single-slice.
- Use `leader-inline-fallback` only after recording why Codex native subagents are unavailable or unsafe.
- Leader-inline-fallback for a one-lane update is preferred over forcing extra subagents.
- Suggested bounded update lanes include diff impact closure, affected claim refresh, user supplement normalization, and conflict reconciliation.
- Do not turn a one-slice or metadata-only refresh into scan-style parallel exploration.
- Use `wait_agent` only at the documented join points before updating graph claims, conflicts, and slices.
- Use `close_agent` after integrating finished subagent results.
