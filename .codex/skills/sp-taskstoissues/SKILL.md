## Invocation Syntax

- In this integration, invoke workflow skills with `$sp-plan`-style syntax.
- References such as `/sp.plan`, `/sp.tasks`, or `next_command: /sp.plan` are canonical workflow-state identifiers and handoff values.
- Preserve those canonical state tokens exactly in artifacts and workflow state; do not rewrite them to this integration's invocation syntax.



## Workflow Contract Summary

- **When to use**: The task plan is stable enough to project onto GitHub issues instead of staying only in `tasks.md`.
- **Primary objective**: Convert the current task graph into actionable GitHub issues while preserving ordering and dependency intent.
- **Primary outputs**: GitHub issues aligned with the current `tasks.md` structure and design artifact context.
- **Default handoff**: Start implementation from the tracked issues or refresh the issue set after later task-plan changes.
- **Execution note**: This summary is routing metadata only. Follow the full contract below end-to-end rather than inferring behavior from the description alone.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Objective

Project the current task plan onto GitHub issues without losing execution ordering, dependency intent, or repository targeting accuracy.

## Context

- Primary inputs: `tasks.md`, the active feature context, and the current Git remote.
- This command assumes the repository remote is a GitHub URL and that issue creation is permitted through the configured GitHub surface.
- The issue projection should stay downstream of the planning workflow rather than becoming a parallel source of truth.

## Process

- Resolve the active feature and task artifacts.
- Confirm the repository remote targets GitHub.
- Create issues that mirror the current task graph closely enough to drive follow-on execution.

## Output Contract

- Produce GitHub issues that align with the active task breakdown.
- Preserve execution intent well enough that later implementation work can follow the issue set without losing the original task structure.
- Abort cleanly if the remote or tooling boundary makes issue creation unsafe.

## Guardrails

- Do not create issues for non-GitHub remotes.
- Do not continue if the target repository cannot be matched to the configured remote.
- Do not treat generated issues as permission to ignore later task-plan updates.

## Mandatory Subagent Execution

All substantive tasks in ordinary `sp-*` workflows default to and must use subagents.

The leader orchestrates: route, split tasks, prepare task contracts, dispatch subagents, wait for structured handoffs, integrate results, verify, and update state.

Before dispatch, every subagent lane needs a task contract with objective, authoritative inputs, allowed read/write scope, forbidden paths, acceptance checks, verification evidence, and structured handoff format.

Use `execution_model: subagent-mandatory`.
Use `dispatch_shape: one-subagent | parallel-subagents`.
Use `execution_surface: native-subagents`.


## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json -RequireTasks -IncludeTasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").
1. From the executed script, extract the path to **tasks**.
1. Get the Git remote by running:

```bash
git config --get remote.origin.url
```

> [!CAUTION]
> ONLY PROCEED TO NEXT STEPS IF THE REMOTE IS A GITHUB URL

1. For each task in the list, use the GitHub MCP server to create a new issue in the repository that is representative of the Git remote.

> [!CAUTION]
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES EVER CREATE ISSUES IN REPOSITORIES THAT DO NOT MATCH THE REMOTE URL
